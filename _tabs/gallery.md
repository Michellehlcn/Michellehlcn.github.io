I am a **Software Engineer** focusing on infrastructure, programming, Linux, open source software, DevOps, containerization, and the cloud. At the moment, I am learning building Kotlin/IOS mobile application.

I have worked in many different languages and platforms but currently that is primarily Python, Javascript, Java and shell scripting. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects which I can add up the value and further ideas.

My non-computer passions are running, swimming, and drawing.Reach out to me (email address below) if you have any questions about these types of things, or just want to chat! michellehlcn.au@gmail.com
